## Things to know before starting working in React

- ### Single Page Web Application (SPA) vs Multi Page Web Application (MPA)
    The core difference between a SPA and a MPA is that with a single-page application, all the requests happen within the lifecycle of a single HTML page. You might be able to see different views, even see different "pages" of the application, but all the rendering takes place within a single HTML web page. This has the advantage of keeping the state of the "application" all in one scope.  
    An MPA, by contrast, will have the user visiting multiple distinct HTML pages. All scripts will be re-executed when the new HTML page loads and any state must be persisted in the session or in local storage. 

- ### Document Object Model (DOM)
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.  
    *Note*: It is called as a Logical structure because DOM doesnâ€™t specify any relationship between objects.  
    DOM is a way to represent the webpage in the structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes or Elements using commands or methods provided by Document object.
